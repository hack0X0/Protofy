# Packages
Protofy is a monorepo with multiple packages. Each package has a core porpuse and we use them together to build the Protofy ecosystem.

The main packages are:
  - [`protolib`](protolib.md) Protofy react library with high level widgets and functions to bootstrap the web/app creation
  - `protoflow` Protofy react library to draw js/ts/jsx/tsx as diagrams
  - `visualui` Protofy react library to do WYSIWYG in react
  - `protodevice` Protofy integration with ESPHome for IoT and device management.
